# Why Ruby?

When choosing a programming language it's always good idea to think
about the reason behind it. My background and professional 
experience is mostly Java based. According to the Pragmatic
Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas you should learn
a new programming language every year. 2013 was my year to learn
Ruby.

A good summary is certainly provided by DHH himself in his video [Why Ruby?](http://vimeo.com/17420638).
If you don't time to watch the whole one hour video here is the summary:

* Blocks
* Testing culture
* Makes it easy to collaborate (github)
* Share the same ethics of code
* It's designed to make programmers happy
* MIT license
* Monkey patching
* Ruby is a friend, not your parent (comparing Ruby to Java) 

## Enumerable
For me one of the greatest joys of Ruby is using [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html).
I think it's very well designed, easy to use as well as to include
in your on classes. Methods like map, each, select, reject, inject,
count, group_by, all?, any?, sort, min and max are such a pleasure to use.
If you are not familiar with Enumerable, I strongly advise learning it.

## REPL
Another bonus, compared to Java, is the [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
A fantastic tool to quickly try out stuff and learn an API through discovery. I often
spend some time in either [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) or IRB before writing any tests.

## Documentation
Maybe because Ruby is such a succinct and expressive language,
it's more common to include code examples in the API documentation.
Taking  [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html) 
as an example. Almost every method has a short code sample on how 
to use it. If found that tremendously helpful, especially if you
start learning a language. Compared this to the
[Java Collection API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html),
which does not contain any code example at all. In case of Java you 
have to look somewhere else, most probably searching the Internet
for a solution. If that code sample is of the same quality, than from
the language maintainers itself (Ruby) is questionable and maybe lead
to poorer and less idiomatic code.

## Parameter defaults
Another comparison to Java. Instead of overloading a method several
times to provide a kind of [default parameters](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/997482/does-java-support-default-parameter-values), I like the way [Ruby](http://www.skorks.com/2009/08/method-arguments-in-ruby/) is doing it. The resulting code is clearer and shorter.

## Conclusion
And last but not least, Ruby is fun to write!
