# Why Ruby?

When choosing a programming language it's always good idea to think
about the reason behind it. My background and professional 
experience is mostly Java based. According to the Pragmatic
Programmer, by Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas you should learn
a new programming language every year. 2013 was my year to learn
Ruby.

A good summary is certainly provided by DHH himself in his video [Why Ruby?](http://vimeo.com/17420638).
If you don't time to watch the whole one hour video here is the summary:
* Blocks
* Testing culture
* Makes it easy to collaborate (github)
* Share the same ethics of code
* It's designed to make programmers happy
* MIT license
* Monkey patching
* Ruby is a friend, not your parent (comparing Ruby to Java) 

All valid points. For me one of the greatest joys of Ruby is using [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html).
I think it's very well designed, easy to use as well as to include
in your on classes. Methods like map, each, select, reject, inject
count, group_by, all?, any?, sort, min and max are such a pleasure to use.
If you are not familiar with Enumerable I strongly advise learning it.

Another bonus, compared to Java, is the [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).
A fantastic tool to quick try out stuff and learn an API through discovery. I often
spend some time in either [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) or IRB before writing any tests.

And last but not least, it's fun to write!
