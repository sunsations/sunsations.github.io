# PPT - Power of plain text

Yes, PPT has more than just one meaning. Taking
Microsoft as a bad example for making file formats
that are proprietary and maybe can't be read in a 
couple of years.

If you are like me and like to be able to read 
your documents for a very long time, choosing plain
text is probably your best bet and the safest strategy.

The main advantages of plain text:
  
  * **Searching**:
    Nothing is easier and faster that grepping over
    plain text. My tool of choice for searching plain
    text is [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).
  * **Versioning**:
    Nothing gets you a better [diff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) than plain
    text when you version you data. My tool of choice GIT together with bitbucket/github.
  * **Editor choice**:
    Nothing gives you more freedom in the choice of your favorite 
    editor.
  * **Operation system**:
    Nothing gives you more freedom to choose and work with your operation
    system of choice. All operation system come with a decent text editor.

Next time you start editing a file, evaluate if you can write it
as plain text. I try to stick with [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), 
since it easy to write and read and additionally lets you convert it to HTML.
